# Feed-Forward Loop Identification for VND7 and MYB46 in vascular expressed cells

## Methods

Downstream targets of VND7, MYB46 FFLs were identified by comparing overlap between significantly expressed genes (log fold change > 0 and a adjusted p-value  <0.05) in Arbidopsis MYB46 and VND7 over expression microarray datasets. For MYB46 GEO dataset GSE16143 was used profiling expression of genes in reponse to 10uM DEX induction in young rosette leaves of Arabidopsis. To predict VND7 direct targets GEO dataset GSE23555 was used where Arabidopsis protoplast were treated with 2 uM estradiol and the  protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide analysed as described by Zhong et al. 2008.

## Results

12 shared, 392 VND7 (with 12 shared genes still included) and 281 MYB46  (with 12 shared genes still included) <br />
recently added vascular genes but these are missin the cesa8 and need cesa4 and lac11 with other ath gene see miguels data for this
